/**
 * Paste into the browser console ON THE DEPLOYED SITE — not localhost, which
 * usually sends no CSP and so passes while production has been broken for weeks.
 *
 * An agent driving a browser can run this via its JavaScript evaluation tool
 * and read the returned object.
 *
 * What this can and cannot see:
 *   CAN  — whether fbevents.js actually loaded past the inline stub
 *   CAN  — whether the pixel initialised and which id
 *   CAN  — the first-party cookies your server needs forwarded
 *   CANNOT — whether an event was delivered. fbq uses navigator.sendBeacon when
 *            an eventID is present, and sendBeacon is invisible to both resource
 *            timing and the devtools Network panel. Use Meta's Test Events for
 *            delivery. See reference/tracking.md.
