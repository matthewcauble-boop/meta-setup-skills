# Publishing campaigns programmatically

## The object hierarchy

```
Campaign          objective, special ad category, buying type
  └─ Ad Set       budget, schedule, targeting, optimization, bid strategy
       └─ Ad      pairs an ad set with a creative
            └─ Ad Creative    image/video + copy + link + CTA, tied to a Page
```

Budget lives on **either** the campaign (CBO) **or** each ad set — not both.
Budget on the ad set requires `is_adset_budget_sharing_enabled` on the campaign.

## Minimal request helper

```js
const GRAPH = 'https://graph.facebook.com/v21.0';

async function graph(path, { method = 'GET', body } = {}) {
  const init = { method, headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.META_ADS_TOKEN}` } };
  if (body) {
    init.headers['Content-Type'] = 'application/json';
    init.body = JSON.stringify(body);
  }
  const res = await fetch(`${GRAPH}/${path}`, init);
  const json = await res.json().catch(() => ({}));
  if (!res.ok) {
    const e = json.error || {};
    // error_user_msg is the human-readable half and is often the only useful part
    throw new Error(`${res.status} ${e.message || JSON.stringify(json).slice(0, 300)}`
      + (e.error_user_msg ? ` — ${e.error_user_msg}` : ''));
  }
  return json;
}
```

Meta errors carry `message` (developer-facing) and sometimes `error_user_msg`
(what the UI would show). Log both; they frequently disagree about the cause.

## Campaign

```js
await graph(`${AD_ACCOUNT}/campaigns`, { method: 'POST', body: {
  name: 'Brand | Market | Objective | 2026-09',
  objective: 'OUTCOME_LEADS',
  status: 'PAUSED',
  special_ad_categories: [],
  buying_type: 'AUCTION',
  is_adset_budget_sharing_enabled: false,
}});
```

Objectives (the ODAX set — the old `LINK_CLICKS`-era names are gone):
`OUTCOME_LEADS`, `OUTCOME_SALES`, `OUTCOME_TRAFFIC`, `OUTCOME_AWARENESS`,
`OUTCOME_ENGAGEMENT`, `OUTCOME_APP_PROMOTION`.

`special_ad_categories` is **immutable after creation.** Getting it wrong means
deleting the campaign and starting over. Employment, housing, credit, social
issues, and elections all have their own category and their own restrictions.

## Ad set

```js
await graph(`${AD_ACCOUNT}/adsets`, { method: 'POST', body: {
  name: 'Market +25mi | Broad',
  campaign_id,
  status: 'PAUSED',
  daily_budget: 3000,                        // CENTS
  billing_event: 'IMPRESSIONS',
  bid_strategy: 'LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP',
  optimization_goal: 'OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS',
  promoted_object: { pixel_id: PIXEL_ID, custom_event_type: 'LEAD' },
  targeting: {
    geo_locations: {
      custom_locations: [{ latitude: 32.08, longitude: -81.09, radius: 25, distance_unit: 'mile' }],
    },
    age_min: 18, age_max: 65, genders: [1, 2],
    targeting_automation: { advantage_audience: 1 },
  },
}});
```

**Budgets are in the account's minor currency unit.** `3000` is $30.00 in a USD
account. Sending dollars creates a 100× overspend, which is the single most
expensive mistake available in this API.

**`bid_strategy` must be explicit.** Meta rejects an ad set that has a budget but
no stated strategy. `LOWEST_COST_WITHOUT_CAP` is the right default for a new
pixel — a bid cap on a pixel with no conversion history throttles delivery
before it can learn.

**Geo targeting** takes either `custom_locations` (lat/lng + radius) or named
`cities` / `regions` / `countries`. Radius is capped at 50 miles, and Special Ad
Categories impose a 15-mile *minimum*. Proximity targeting around several points
is how you cover a corridor without buying a whole state.

Common optimization goals: `OFFSITE_CONVERSIONS` (needs `promoted_object`),
`LEAD_GENERATION` (instant forms), `LANDING_PAGE_VIEWS`, `LINK_CLICKS`,
`REACH`, `THRUPLAY`.

## Uploading an image

Images go up as multipart — a JSON helper cannot carry the file.

```js
const form = new FormData();
form.append('filename', new Blob([readFileSync(file)]), basename(file));
const res = await fetch(`${GRAPH}/${AD_ACCOUNT}/adimages`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}` },
  body: form,
});
const json = await res.json();
const hash = Object.values(json.images)[0].hash;
```

The response keys images by a mangled filename, so read the value rather than
looking the key up.

## Ad creative

```js
await graph(`${AD_ACCOUNT}/adcreatives`, { method: 'POST', body: {
  name: 'variant-a',
  object_story_spec: {
    page_id: PAGE_ID,
    link_data: {
      image_hash: hash,
      link: 'https://example.com/landing?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=paid&utm_campaign=...',
      message: PRIMARY_TEXT,     // the body copy above the image
      name: HEADLINE,            // bold line under the image
      description: DESCRIPTION,  // small line under the headline
      call_to_action: { type: 'LEARN_MORE' },
    },
  },
}});
```

A creative is **immutable**. Changing copy or image means creating a new
creative and a new ad. There is no edit.

CTA types include `LEARN_MORE`, `APPLY_NOW`, `BOOK_TRAVEL`, `CONTACT_US`,
`GET_QUOTE`, `SIGN_UP`, `SHOP_NOW`, `CALL_NOW`. Some are restricted by objective.

Put the variant name in `utm_content` so performance is attributable in your own
analytics, not only in Ads Manager.

## Ad

```js
await graph(`${AD_ACCOUNT}/ads`, { method: 'POST', body: {
  name: 'variant-a',
  adset_id,
  creative: { creative_id },
  status: 'PAUSED',
}});
```

## Replacing creative

Since creatives are immutable, iterating means delete-and-recreate the ads:

```js
const existing = await graph(`${adsetId}/ads?fields=id,name&limit=50`);
for (const ad of existing.data) await graph(ad.id, { method: 'DELETE' });
// then create new creatives + ads as above
```

Deleting the *ads* keeps the ad set's learning. Deleting the ad set resets it.

## Reading results

```js
await graph(`${campaignId}/insights?fields=spend,impressions,clicks,actions,cost_per_action_type`
          + `&date_preset=last_7d&level=ad`);
```

`actions` is an array of `{ action_type, value }` — conversions are in there
under names like `offsite_conversion.fct.lead`, not as a top-level field.

**Attributed conversions are not caused conversions.** Meta reports what it can
match to an impression or click within the attribution window, which includes
people who would have converted anyway. For anything with a real budget, compare
against a holdout or a before/after on total volume rather than trusting the
in-platform number.

## Safety rules for an agent

- **Create PAUSED. Always.** Enabling is a separate, human-confirmed step.
- **Dry-run first.** A `--check` mode that does no writes catches permission and
  config problems before any object exists.
- **Range-check the budget** before sending. Assert it's an integer within an
  expected band; a `NaN` or a dollars-instead-of-cents value should throw.
- **Clean up orphans** from failed runs before retrying.
- **Never commit the token.** Environment only.
